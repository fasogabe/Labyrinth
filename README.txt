-------------------------------------------------------------HOW TO PLAY---------------------------------------------------------------

Hello! Welcome to Labyrinth. We have developed an intuitive Labyrinth game as part of the CS 205 final project. Upon running 
the system, select whether you would like to play a human or a computer. Player 1 is the blue dot that starts in the top left corner, 
with their treasure pieces collected being on the left side of the treasure grid. Player 2 is the green dot that starts in the 
bottom right, with their treasure pieces collected being on the right side of the treasure grid. Player 1 starts first. 

To rotate the spare piece, click the arrows the spare piece one time. A Player must insert the spare piece, located at the top right of the 
GUI by double clicking on the arrows surrounding the board. If they try moving on the board first instead of inserting a piece, nothing will 
happen and the program will wait until the spare is inserted. If it does not work on the first double click, wait a few seconds and double click with more force on the click. 
The event handler of the GUI is sometimes non responsive on light double clicks. If the spare piece has a treasure on it, the spare treasure box will 
have a emoji on it with the corresponding treasure; if not, the box will be empty. Next, the player selects where they would like to move
on the board. If a player selects a spot on the board that is not valid, the program will do nothing until a valid 
selection has been made. This must be performed by double clicking hard on a tile piece. Once a player has landed on their
treasure piece, the treasure will be populated in the treasure pieces collected grid at the bottom right side of the GUI.
Once a player reaches 12 pieces collected the game ends and the player is declared the winner. If you are still having trouble
with the gameplay, the help button on the top right of the GUI will guide you through your difficulties.
